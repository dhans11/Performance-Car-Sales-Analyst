## 💻 **Problem Statement**

Car sales at some dealerships fluctuated significantly between 2021 and 2023. While some dealers such as Honda Shenzen and Honda Guangzhou recorded a steady increase, other dealers such as Honda Da Nang and Honda Ratchaburi had relatively low sales and showed no significant improvement. This imbalance affected the overall regional performance and hindered sales optimization in certain markets.
